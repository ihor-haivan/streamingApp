# StreamingApp

A Python-based streaming application that demonstrates real-time streaming processing combined with shell-based automation. This project is designed to serve as a foundation or proof-of-concept for building robust streaming solutions and can be adapted to various use cases that require handling streaming media and logging events.

## Overview

StreamingApp is a modular project that leverages Python for core streaming logic and Shell scripts to automate operational tasks. It is structured with a focus on clarity and maintainability, making it easy for contributors to extend or adapt its functionality.

> **Note:** This README serves as a starting point. Update the sections as the project evolves to accurately reflect the features and instructions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Streaming Processing:** Efficient handling of streaming content using Python’s robust libraries.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with core logic in `src/` and operational scripts in `bin/`.
- **Integrated Logging:** Captures important runtime events and errors in the `logs/` directory.
- **Shell Automation:** Provides helper scripts in the `bin/` folder to simplify deployment and execution.
- **Cross-Platform (Unix-Focused):** Initially designed for Unix-like systems with potential for Windows support upon configuration adjustments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Operating System:** Unix-based (Linux/macOS preferred); Windows users may need to adjust some shell scripts.
- **(Optional) Virtual Environment:** Recommended to keep dependencies isolated.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ihor-haivan/streamingApp.git
   cd streamingApp
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   If a `requirements.txt` exists, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Otherwise, manually install the required libraries as you expand on the project.*

## Usage

To start StreamingApp, use one of the available entry points:

- **Using the Shell Script:**

  Navigate to the `bin/` folder and run:

  ```bash
  bash bin/start.sh
  ```

- **Directly via Python:**

  Run the main application script located in the `src/` directory:

  ```bash
  python src/main.py
  ```

*Customize these commands as your project structure and entry points evolve.*
